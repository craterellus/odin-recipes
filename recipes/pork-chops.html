        <h2>Description</h2>
        When I'm shopping for groceries, I tend to avoid pork. It's not that I dislike it. On the contrary, I quite like it-- but only when it's made right! And therin lies the issue. It's easy to mess up with pork. Do you ever have that issue? This recipe makes it easy for us! Short and sweet, you end up with tender breaded pork chops every time!
        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>2 tablespoons butter, melted </li>
            <li>1 large egg, beaten </li>
            <li>2 tablespoons milk </li>
            <li>Â¼ teaspoon black pepper </li>
            <li>1 cup herb-seasoned dry bread stuffing mix </li>
            <li>4 pork chops, trimmed </li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Instructions</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Preheat the oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C). Pour butter into a 9x13-inch baking dish.</li>
            <li>Whisk together egg, milk, and pepper in a shallow dish. Place stuffing mix in a separate shallow dish. Dip pork chops in egg mixture, then coat with stuffing mix. Lay pork chops in the prepared dish.</li>
            <li>Bake in the preheated oven for 10 minutes. Flip chops and bake until no longer pink in the center and juices run clear, about 10 more minutes. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read at least 145 degrees F (74 degrees C).</li>
        </ol>
